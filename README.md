# GameDevOfUnemployeds
Starting from Sep. 2021.
This is one of the first co-projects of us.
As nube developers, we start from copying well-known codes and getting friendly with C#.
Our final goal is to develop an Android game and deploy it in the Google PlayStore.
However, the main lesson of this project should be :
  Getting familiar with co-working using git
  Establish our own step on learning (relatively) new languages

## First Step : Set environment
